I miss this app too but unfortunately by legal reason I don't host the lyrics and looks like they were taken down, I'm browsing some possibilities with P2P or AI but nothing was defined yet, sorry.

#### Using it with youtube
If you're using Chromium based browsers you can use lyrics on Youtube with this [browser-playerctl extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-playerctl/ojjjidifjmbbckdjfiagdfdepbcmnicg).

#### Known issue
Lyrics isn't able to syncronize with Spotify App (at least for free accounts) due to null MPRIS position, so the Lyrics will always start from beginnig wherever the track position is.

## Downloading lyrics

To enable the app to download lyrics you should install also [lyricsources](https://github.com/naaando/lyricsources), a python library adapted from [OSDLyrics](https://github.com/osdlyrics/osdlyrics)

## Building and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:

    libglib2.0-dev
    libgranite-dev
    libgtk-3-dev
    libcairo2-dev
    libsoup-dev
    xmlbird
    meson
    valac
    gettext


Ubuntu 23.10

```shell
sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libgranite-dev libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev meson valac libsoup2.4-dev libsoup-gnome2.4-dev libxmlbird-dev gettext
```

Run `meson` to configure the build environment and then `ninja` to build

    meson build --prefix=/usr/local
    ninja -C build
